# How to disable EditText from stealing the focus
EditText view has a tendency to always keep the focus, for example even after you check a radio button the focus and the cursor stay inside the EditText.

It also gets focus on activity start, this means that if it's not handled than when the app is opened the focus is at the EditText and the keyboard is opened.

There are a few stages to the solution, you can implement all or just a part of them depending on the requirement.
